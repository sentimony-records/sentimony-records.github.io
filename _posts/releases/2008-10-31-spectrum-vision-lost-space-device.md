Spectrum Vision was founded in 2004 by two talented musicians from Stupino, Russia, near Moscow: Alexander (1n0x) and Ivan (Ujo). «Lost Space Device» is their debut album on Sentimony Records, originally released in 2008. 

The main focus of the project is psychedelic downtempo and ambient works distinguished by subtle ethnic themes with deep dimensions and beautiful melodic leads.
