Sentimony Records team is proudly pleased to announce «Aurora», their third EP. At this time we're introducing you the debut single by Tentura project, a well-known psychedelic chillout and deep trance duo from Kyiv, Ukraine.

The project was formed by two talented guys: composer Ader (Alexander Pidgorny) and psytrance Dj Maket (Stanislav Yastremsky). Quite often, Alexander and Stanislav perform their live performances at the Ukrainian festivals, open airs, and indoor parties.
